You're looking for a way to keep your data safe from prying eyes? Look no further than this cybersecurity project that's got the goods on text encryption. We're talking top-notch algorithms like AES, DES, and RSA - the crème de la crème of secure data protection.

This Python code is the real deal, leveraging the cryptography library to show off its symmetric and asymmetric encryption chops. Here's the lowdown:

First, we're importing the necessary modules and classes. We've got Fernet from cryptography.fernet for AES symmetric encryption, and a whole host of other goodies from cryptography.hazmat.primitives for various cryptographic functions. And let's not forget generate_private_key and public_key from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa for generating RSA key pairs.

Now, onto the functions:

    aes_encryption(message, key): This one takes a message and an AES key as input, creates a Fernet object, and encrypts the message. Boom! Encrypted message returned.
    rsa_encryption(message, public_key): This one takes a message and an RSA public key as input, loads the public key, and encrypts the message with OAEP and SHA-256. Done! Encrypted message returned.

Next up, we're generating keys like they're going out of style. AES key? Check. RSA key pair? You bet. We're assigning the private key to private_key and the public key to public_key. And just for kicks, we're serializing the public key as a PEM-encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo object and saving it to pem.

Time for a test drive. We've got a super-secret message - "A really secret message, maybe a pincode" - and we're encrypting it with both AES and RSA using our freshly generated keys. The encrypted messages? Completely different each time, because that's how encryption rolls.
